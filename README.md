# Story Protocol Validator Node Setup Guide

Story raised $140M from Tier1 investors. Story is a blockchain making IP protection and licensing programmable and efficient. It automates IP management, allowing creators to easily license, remix, and monetize their work. With Story, traditional legal complexities are replaced by on-chain smart contracts and off-chain legal agreements, simplifying the entire process.

# Code Breakdown (Menu Function)

## 1. node_management_menu():  
   - This is the primary function that displays a menu to the user.  
   - The menu has 20 different options for managing various aspects of the Story Protocol node.  
   - **Options List**: A list of available actions, like "Install Dependencies," "Story-Geth Binary Setup," "Node Status," etc., is presented to the user.  
   - The script waits for user input, validates the selection, and then calls the appropriate function corresponding to the chosen option.  

## 2. Menu Options  
**Each option is mapped to a specific function that performs a task. Here are the details for each option:**

1. **Install-Dependencies**:  
   This function installs all the necessary software packages and libraries required for the Story Protocol node to operate correctly. It ensures that the environment is set up with all prerequisites, minimizing compatibility issues and making the setup process smoother.

2. **Story-Geth Binary Setup**:  
   This option sets up the Story-Geth binary, which is essential for facilitating Ethereum-like interactions within the Story Protocol. It involves downloading the binary files, setting the correct paths, and ensuring that the node can communicate effectively with the Ethereum network.

3. **Story Binary Setup**:  
   Configures the primary binary for the Story Protocol, which is responsible for handling various node operations. This function ensures that the binary is correctly installed and optimized for performance, enabling efficient processing of transactions and smart contracts on the network.

4. **Setup Moniker Name**:  
   This function allows users to assign a unique name (moniker) to their node. This name helps in identifying the node on the network and can be useful for both management and monitoring purposes. It also enhances the user experience by personalizing the node's identity.

5. **Update-Peers**:  
   Updates the node’s peer list, which is crucial for maintaining a healthy connection to the network. This function retrieves the latest list of peers, ensuring that the node is synchronized with active participants in the blockchain, thereby enhancing data reliability and network performance.

6. **Update-Snapshot**:  
   Syncs the node with the latest blockchain snapshot, which can significantly reduce the time it takes to catch up with the current state of the blockchain. This function downloads the most recent snapshot, allowing the node to synchronize more quickly and efficiently, particularly after periods of downtime.

7. **Stop-Node**:  
   Safely stops the processes of the node, ensuring that all operations are halted gracefully. This function prevents data corruption by allowing the node to complete ongoing transactions and save its state before shutting down, making it essential for maintenance and updates.

8. **Start-Node**:  
   Activates the node on the network, initiating its operations and allowing it to begin processing transactions. This function ensures that the node connects to the blockchain and starts syncing with the latest data, enabling it to participate in network activities.

9. **Refresh-Node**:  
   Restarts the node to apply updates and configurations without requiring an extended downtime. This function is particularly useful for implementing changes to the node’s setup or software, ensuring minimal disruption to its operations.

10. **Logs-Checker**:  
    Displays the node's logs, which are essential for monitoring its performance and debugging any issues. This function allows users to view real-time logs, helping to identify errors, performance bottlenecks, or other operational concerns that may arise during node operation.

11. **Node-Status**:  
    Shows the current status and health of the node, providing users with vital information about its performance, uptime, and connectivity. This function helps users quickly assess whether their node is functioning correctly and if any actions are needed.

12. **Validator-Info**:  
    Provides details about the node’s validator status, including information about rewards, active validators, and the node’s participation in the network. This function is crucial for users who are actively staking tokens and want to track their validator performance.

13. **Private-Key Checker**:  
    Verifies and displays the node’s private key, which is essential for maintaining security and ensuring that the user has access to their funds. This function helps users confirm the integrity of their private key, ensuring that it has not been compromised.

14. **Balance-Checker**:  
    Checks the node’s token balance, allowing users to view their current holdings within the network. This function is important for managing assets, tracking rewards, and making informed decisions about staking or other actions.

15. **Stake-IP**:  
    Stakes tokens for validator participation, enabling the node to contribute to the network’s security and transaction validation. This function interacts with the staking mechanisms of the Story Protocol, allowing users to earn rewards for their contributions.

16. **UnStake-IP**:  
    Unstakes tokens, removing them from the staking pool. This function allows users to reclaim their staked assets and can be useful for managing liquidity or adjusting participation in the network.

17. **Full-Backup**:  
    Backs up the node’s data and configurations, ensuring that important information is preserved. This function creates a snapshot of the node's current state, allowing for easy restoration in case of failures or data loss.

18. **Recovery-Backup**:  
    Restores a previously created backup, allowing users to recover their node’s data and settings. This function is essential for disaster recovery, ensuring that users can quickly get their nodes back up and running after an unexpected issue.

19. **Remove-Node**:  
    Completely uninstalls the node setup, removing all associated files and configurations. This function is useful for users who wish to decommission their nodes or start fresh with a new setup, ensuring that all traces of the previous installation are cleaned up.

20. **Exit**:  
    Closes the script and exits the menu, providing a graceful way to terminate the session. This function ensures that any ongoing processes are safely halted before exiting the management interface.



# Error Handling && Interactive Prompt
1. **Interactive Prompt**:  
   The `while true` loop keeps the script running until the user selects the "Exit" option (Option 20).  
   For each selection, the script displays relevant information and calls the corresponding function to perform the action.

2. **Error Handling**:  
   If an invalid option is chosen, the script prompts the user to enter a valid number (between 1 and 20).
